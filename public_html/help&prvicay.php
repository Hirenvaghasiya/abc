<h2><a name="intro"></a>Do you have some cool code you want to share?</h2>
<p>Sharing code with others is a <span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_4">great way</span> to not only help others, but also to become a better 
programmer. You'll get a lot of positive feedback, suggestions for improvements, <span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_3">bug fixes</span>, free 
testing, and more often than not, suggestions on how to make the code itself even better. It also 
encourages others to share their code, which in turn gives you access to an even larger base of free 
<span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_2">source code</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="how"></a>How it works</h2>
<p>You can submit either a full article with downloads and images, or just a <span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_5">quick Tip</span> n' Trick.
Tips n tricks are meant to be very, very short tips, snippets or even just a one-liner you came
across that saved your day. Articles are for presenting more detailed ideas.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two ways to submit an article: via email to 
<a href="mailto:Submit@ask4u.com">Submit@ask4u.com</a> 
or via the Article Submission Wizard.</li>
<li>Articles submitted via the submission wizard will initially be in an "unedited" state. Articles
submitted via email will be posted in an "edited" state.</li>
<li>If your article is not yet edited then you can continue to modify your article via the Modify 
button on the article itself, or by sending us your changes via email at 
Submit@<span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_7">ask4u</span>.com - you choose.</li>
<li>If you post using the submission wizard then your article will go into a moderation queue where 
<span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_6">high level</span> members can review and approve your article. During moderation you can edit your article 
as often as necessary, and very soon (within a few hours) it will be approved for general viewing, 
unless there are issues with the article that need addressing.</li>
<li>An editor may then formally edit your article which involves reviewing your downloads, images,
text and formatting and polishing the entire article. Once this is done you may continue to send us
updates to your article as often as you like to Submit@ask4u.com, 
but direct editing is no longer possible since it may undo the editing work already done. Just let us 
know if you do not wish for your article to get this final polish.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="tips"></a>Tips</h2>

<p>If you post to ask4u then your code is offered under 
the terms of our Terms of Use and under the 
specific license agreement attached to the article. You also agree to the
 Contributors Agreement, which
 ensures you have the right to post the content, allows us to actually publish your content,
 and provides further protection for you on top of the License you choose for your content.</p>
<p>The primary focus for articles on ask4u is code that is available 
without registration or licence fees and without time restrictions, that showcases applications or binaries 
and their source code. ask4u articles are for sharing 
source code, not applications or components.
</p><p>Note that source code associated with an article that was written by the author
must be provided with the article. External links to the most up-to-date version
(or <span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_1">online demo</span>) are fine, but we still require at least a workable version to be
submitted with your article to be made available on ask4u. The reason for
this is that 9 times out of 10 links to external downloads break within months due
to any number of unavoidable factors. Having a local copy on ask4u
means at least some code will still be available.</p>
<p>We do allow articles on Third Party Products and Tools, provided the following rules are strictly 
followed:
    </p><ol>
        <li>Must provide significant innovation and cannot simply be a how-to guide that would appear on the vendor's own help pages or must 
        solve a significant problem common to users of the third party product or library</li>
        <li>Must not be an advertisement for the product. We are the final judges on this. There will be no mention of price, offers or
        coupons, upgrades, trials or anything that would induce or tempt a person to visit the third party site and download the product. This
        article is purely for those who already use the product.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to replace any links to the product with search-engine unfriendly links. Articles must not be used to promote
        a product in any form, including SEO.</li>
        <li>Must be tagged "third-party"</li>
        <li>Must be in the Third Party Products and Tools section</li>
        <li>Articles tagged this way will not appear on the homepage or the newsletter</li>
        <li>Must not be written by anyone associated with the company. Self promotion is not allowed.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Similarly, we allow reviews on third party products and tools provided the following rules are strictly followed:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Must provide an unbiased review of a product or service</li>
        <li>Must not be an advertisement for the product. We are the final judges on this. Basic information on pricing is permitted.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to replace any links to the product with search-engine unfriendly links. Articles must not be 
        used to promote a product in any form, including SEO.</li>
        <li>Must be tagged "third-party"</li>
        <li>Must be in the Reviews on Third Party Products and Tools
        section</li>
        <li>Articles tagged this way will not appear on the homepage or the newsletter</li>
        <li>Must not be written by anyone associated with the company. Self promotion is not allowed.</li>
    </ol>

        
    <h2>
        <a name="Prepare"></a>Preparing your code</h2>
    <p>
        If you have some great code, but do not make it easy for others to use it, then
        more often than not people will pass it by and not use it. We suggest:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write a brief description of your code, including what it is, what it does, and
            how to use it in your projects (Download a 
            template file here, and read template instructions 
            here</li>
        <li>Explain any tricky problems that you solved while developing the code. It makes
            great reading and helps others solve similar problems.</li>
        <li>Comment your code</li>
        <li>Include a <b>small</b> screen shot</li>
        <li>Prepare a <b>small</b> app to demonstrate the code (only if appropriate)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Submit"></a>Submitting your code</h2>
    <p>
        When submitting your code and article please check you have the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Article</u> explaining your code</li>
        <li>Small screen shot (PNG/GIF/JPEG only, maximum width 600 pixels)</li>
        <li><u>Zip file</u> containing your <u>source files</u>
            (if appropriate)</li>
        <li><u>Zip file</u> containing your <u>sample application</u>
            (if appropriate)</li>
        <li>Name and contact details</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Package all this up into a <b><u>single zip file</u> </b>and send it
        to <a href="mailto:Submit@ask4u.com">
            Submit@ask4u.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When emailing the article please state the title of the article in the subject line.
        Also if you think it neatly fits in one of the categories, please let us know.</p>
    <h2>
        <a name="Update"></a>Updating Your Code</h2>
    <p>
        If you posted your article using the <u>Article Submission Wizard</u>, and it's still marked as 'Unedited' then you 
        can edit the article yourself by clicking on the 'Edit this article' link at the top right 
        of the article.</p>
    <p>
        If you sent the article in to us via email at Submit@ask4u.com, 
        or uploaded your article using the <u>article 
        upload page</u>, or the article has been edited, then simply visit your article and at the 
        top right you will find a "Update your article" link. Follow that link and upload your 
        changes directly to the editors using the form provided. </p>
    <p>Alternatively, send an email to Submit@ask4u.com with the 
       <b>name of the article and its URL in the email body</b>, and attach the
        files to your message as a zip file (for downloads) or PNG/GIF/JPEG for images. Obviously
        the smaller the better, and please note we can't accept .exe files, or zips containing .exe
        files. Our email provider will, unfortunately, reject such emails.</p>
    <h3>
        Updating the article text</h3>
    <p>
        We reformat each article that is submitted, and try our best to ensure that all
        grammar and spelling mistakes have been corrected. It is far, <b>far</b> easier
        for us if you first download the HTML for your article that we have posted using the
        "Get HTML" button at the top right of your article. Logon to ask4u
        and at the top right of your article will be a link 'Get Article's HTML'. Click
        on this and then save the HTML for your article using the File | Save menu in your
        browser. Ignore the stuff at the top and bottom of your page - you will see "Article
        Starts" and "Article Ends" tags in the HTML that point to where the actual text
        for your article is. Strip out everything above and below these markers and edit
        the HTML directly
    </p>
    <p>
        If you only have a very small addition to make, or want to report spelling/grammar
        or link errors then you can just send these in as plain text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Send all updates to us and remember to <strong>include the name of the article and its
            URL in the email body.</strong></p>
    <h3>Syntax colourisation</h3>
    <p>You don't need to worry about colourising your articles. We have a colouriser that takes care 
    of this for you. If your article already contains colourisation then don't worry - the colouriser 
    cleans out all previous colourising before recolourising the entire article.</p>
    
    <p><b>Advanced Colouriser Tip</b>: To specify a language besides the default C-style colourisation,
    add a 'Lang' attribute in the &lt;pre&gt; or &lt;code&gt; tag. eg:</p>
    <pre lang="html"><span class="code-keyword">&lt;</span><span class="code-leadattribute">pre</span> <span class="code-attribute">lang</span><span class="code-keyword">="</span><span class="code-keyword">C#"</span><span class="code-keyword">&gt;</span>int myVar = 0;<span class="code-keyword">&lt;</span><span class="code-keyword">/</span><span class="code-leadattribute">pre</span><span class="code-keyword">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>The currently supported languages are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain Text (lang="text")</li>

    <h2>The Article<a name="Article"></a></h2>
    <p>
        First and foremost, <b>we need <i>some</i> documentation</b>. This doesn't have
        to be anything fancy, though we don't mind if it is, but if you think about answering
        the following questions then you should be off to a good start.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does the code do?</li>
        <li>How do I integrate it with my existing code or how do I use it?</li>
        <li>If there is a similar article on ask4u already, then how 
            does this one differ? Why would someone want to use your version?</li>
        <li>Is there some aspect of the code that is of particular interest that perhaps should
            be covered in the article?</li>
        <li>Are there any particular environments the code is restricted to? (Windows 2000 or
            above, .NET SP1 etc)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The idea is to give the reader a clear idea of the purpose of your code, instead
        of forcing them to download a project, build it and then hunt around to find out
        what the sample does. This means articles that are code snippets, with no explanation 
        of what the snippet does, are insufficient. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The quickest way to get your code posted is to provide a simple HTML file. Our preferences
        on documentation are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A simple HTML edited by a plain text editor or good HTML editor, using the <u>template file</u> provided,</li>
        <li>A plain ol' text file,</li>
        <li>Everything else.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All the articles at ask4u have the same look and feel which is 
        achieved by only the most basic HTML features. If you send us a HTML file with 
        different fonts and colours and fancy bits, chances are it will all be stripped 
        out to make it conform to the ask4u standard. All 
        documentation is edited <b>by hand</b>, so it can be a real nightmare
        wading through masses of convoluted HTML.
    </p>
    
    <h2><a name="License"></a>License</h2>
    <p>
       When uploading an article you need to be aware of the risks and legal issues involved. We live
       in a litigious world so you need to protect yourself against those seeking damages against you
       for problems that may (or may not) have been caused by your article. Just saying
       "The code is free for use" is no longer enough. What does "free" mean? Are 
       there any restrictions? What happens if your code breaks my system and costs me money?

       The following is a rough guide to the current licenses supported on
       ask4u: 
      <u>Licenses</u>.
    </p><h2>
        <a name="Zip"></a>The Zip file</h2>
    <p>
        Please ensure that you zip all files up using maximum compression, and remove all
        unnecessary files (*.opt, *.ncb, *.obj, *.aps, *.plg, .suo etc.) from the project
        folders. If possible, please keep submissions below 300Kb.</p>
    <div class="callout"><b>We cannot accept .exe or zips with .exe files in them via email. Our 
        email provider	will bounce these emails</b>. If you wish to submit a compiled demo of your 
        code then it's easiest to send it to us via the <u>article
        submission form</u>.</div>
    <p>
        <b>File naming convention:</b> If your contribution comprises a HTML article, source
        code and an image, then to make life easy for us we ask that you follow the following
        filename conventions. Suppose your article is called coolcode.html. The filenames
        should be of the form:<br>
    </p>
    <table width="100%">
        <tbody><tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode.html</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                The HTML documentation for your article</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode.zip</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                The zipped source code for your article</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode.png</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                An image to accompany your article</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <p>
        Alternatively, if you have source code, a demo project and a number of images, then
        your filenames would be along the lines of:
    </p>
    <table width="100%">
        <tbody><tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode.html</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                The HTML documentation for your article</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode_src.zip</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                The zipped source code for your article</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode_demo.zip</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                The zipped demo project for your article</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode1.png</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                An image to accompany your article</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%">
                coolcode2.png</td>
            <td style="width: 70%">
                A second image to accompany your article</td>
        </tr>

        BTW, don't use the name coolcode, try to find something more relevant :-)</p>
    <h2>
        <a name="SourceCode"></a>Source code Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        First and foremost, does the code actually work? We do sometimes get code that,
        for one reason or another, just does not work. Please check that the source code
        you send compiles cleanly, and if part of a larger demo application, that the application
        itself runs OK.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do ask that the general conventions be adhered for your language to so that other
        programmers can understand your code easily. Conventions that help other programmers
        read your code are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The use of Hungarian notation in MFC (e.g. Variable prefixes such as "n" for int,
            "d" for double etc.)</li>
        <li>The use of Win32/Visual C++ types such as UINT, LPCTSTR etc.</li>
        <li>Camel case in .NET code</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Also, does the code compile cleanly under the warning level 4?</p>
    <h2>
        Sample Project<a name="Sample"></a></h2>
    <p>
        <b>Sample Executable:</b> If providing a sample executable, please make sure it
        is linked with the <b>release </b>libraries (ie. <b>Make sure it is not linked with
            the Unicode or debug libraries</b>). The whole point of a demo executable is
        to give developers a quick intro to your code. If they have to recompile in order
        to get the application to run on their system then there is no use in supplying
        the executable in the first place. Secondly try to conservative about just how big
        a sample you upload, a 4Mb sample just isn't going to interest a lot of people.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Sample Project:</b>It is recommended that you also include a sample project.
        When creating a zip file for the sample project, please do not include either the
        Debug or the Release directories. They simply inflate the size of the ZIP file.
        Also, do not include the *.clw, *.ncb, *.opt and other such files that are automatically
        recreated.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <a name="Other"></a>Submitting an article based on another person's work</h2>
    <p>
        It is OK to use others' code as a <span class="bhi52z19" id="bhi52z19_8">base</span> as long as you make it totally clear that
        some/most of the code isn't yours. <strong><b>If you use someone else's code then DO
        NOT remove their copyright notices</b>.</strong> There is a lot of code reuse
        here, that's the point after all. As far as the articles that are being posted here
        we expect to see credit where credit's due, in the code and the HTML as appropriate.</p>
    <p>
        If you are submitting a modification, extension or correction to another person's
        work then we ask that you attempt to contact the original author first and then
        try to liaise with him/her to produce an update to the original article. This way
        we can retain continuity with the original article as well as reducing the number
        of completely new pages that need posting.</p>
    <h2>
        <a name="Elsewhere"></a>Submitting code already posted at another site</h2>
    <p>
        You are more than welcome to submit code that is already published at another site,
        <b>provided</b> you own the copyright on that article, and provided you have not
        given the other site exclusive rights to your article.</p>
    <h2>
        <a name="Template"></a>ask4u Submission Template</h2>
    <p>
        The <u>template zip file</u> contains a HTML template
        for use when submitting articles to ask4u. We recommend 
        editing this file using Microsoft Expression Web, Dreamweaver or your favourite text editor. 
        Note that all extraneous formatting (crazy colours, absolute positioning etc) will be 
        removed in order to maintain a uniform appearance and help our readers.</p>
        <p>
            Using these templates will help us post your article sooner. We are using MS IIS
            and ASP pages on the server, allowing us to simplify the templates used to create
            the articles.</p>
        <p>
            To fill in the template just follow the 3 easy steps below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill in the article description details</li>
            <li>Add links to your images and downloads</li>
            <li>Include the main article text</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            That's all there is to it! All formatting will be done by the ASP script engine.</p>

    <h2>Foreign language submissions</h2>
    <p>ask4u is an English-language site. While we welcome
    those from all cultures and all walks of life, we do ask that only English language articles be
    posted.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="Blogs"></a>Technical Blog Submissions</h2>
    
    <p>Blog entries serve the same purpose as articles: to help developers with coding related 
    issues. A good general guide to follow when deciding whether to submit your 
    Blog feed and tag your blog entries
    is: is there a section that relates to your blog topic? 

    </p><p><b>Things that are a Must</b></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Have some kind of technical basis (no entries on restaurants, great beers, or day to day 
    affairs)</li>
    <li>Present a problem and a solution</li>
    <li>Write a brief description of your code, including what it is, what it does, and how it was 
    used in your projects </li>
    <li>Be at least 1000 characters long </li>
    <li>Be more than a quick tip, or small entry more fit for an FAQ </li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Other things to Note</b></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Downloadable source code is not required. </li>
    <li>Code snippets are always welcome </li>
    <li>Pictures are also always welcome </li>
    <li>Your Technical blog entries are licensed according to your default license set in your
    profile. Click 'My Settings' and then 'Articles' to change this default</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="Videos"></a>Video Article Submissions</h2>

    <p>Please ensure that video articles are less than 20 minutes long, preferably 10 minutes or 
    less.</p>
